                        <p>
                            This page describes who I am as a learner, how I approach learning,
                            and the skills and habits I am developing throughout the year.

                    <div class="box1title">Who I Am as a Learner</div>
                        <p>
                            I’m a learner who prefers understanding over just memorizing or reading a material. 
                            I like knowing why something works rather than just straight up agreeing and etc. <br><br>
                            I learn best when I am given the space to explore ideas independently, reflect on my progress, have enough of encouragement for my achievements so I don’t feel that all the things I have worked hard for aren’t a waste and improve through consistent effort. 
                            I may take time to build confidence, but once I commit to learning something, I am persistent and focused.

                <div class="box1title">Interests That Shape My Learning</div>
                <p>
                    My interests strongly influence how I learn and grow as a learner!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <b>Coding (Web Dev):</b> <br><br>
                    Coding and especially web dev allows me to express the way I think. 
                    While working on projects, I enjoy breaking down problems into smaller parts and finding logical solutions while debugging. 
                    Creating websites helps me apply concepts practically rather than only learning them theoretically. <br><br>

                    Through coding, I have learned to debug my own mistakes, be patient with the process.
                    This interest has strengthened my problem-solving skills, critical thinking and encouraged me to explore learning independently beyond the classroom.
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                    <b>Badminton:</b> <br><br>
                    Badminton has significantly shaped the way I approach learning and growth. Training regularly has taught me discipline, consistency, and patience. Improvement in badminton is gradual, and this has helped me understand that effort does not always show immediate results.
                    There have been phases where progress felt really slow, which was mentally challenging, but these experiences taught me resilience and persistence. <br><br>
                    I learned to accept feedback from my coaches, reflect on my performance, and continue working on my weaknesses. 
                    This mindset has strongly influenced me academically, especially when dealing with difficult topics or obstacles.
                    </li><br><br>

                    <li>
                    <b>MUN:</b> <br><br>
                    Participating in Model United Nations challenged me to step outside my comfort zone. 
                    It required me to do deep research, think critically about global issues, and express my ideas clearly, respectfully and diplomatically. <br><br>

                    Initially, speaking in formal settings felt very intimidating, but over time I became confident in presenting my thoughts and responding to different viewpoints of delegates.
                    MUN helped me develop communication skills, research skills, and the ability to remain calm under a lot of pressure. 
                    These skills have positively influenced both my academic learning and my confidence as a learner.

                <p>
                    Through my learning experiences this year, I have become more aware of my strengths
                    and the areas I want to improve. I am learning to take ownership of my learning
                    and understand that growth comes from effort, reflection, and consistency.

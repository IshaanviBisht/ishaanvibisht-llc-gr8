                    <div class="box1title">My Goals for Grade 9</div>
                    <p>
                        Grade 9 marks an important transition in my learning journey. Obviously, since I'll be going to high school.
                        My goals for this year focus on building strong habits, managing my responsibilities better, and growing both academically and personally!
                        These goals are not just about results/marks, but about developing discipline, confidence, and consistency.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="box1">
                    <div class="box1title">Time Management and Discipline</div>
                    <p>
                        One of my biggest goals for Grade 9 is to improve how I manage my time.
                        As academic workload and responsibilities increase and it'll in the coming years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I aim to create a balanced routine that allows time for studies, skill development, badminton training, and rest
                        without feeling overwhelmed or burnt out.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Plan:</b> Completing tasks on time, avoiding last-minute stress, and feeling in control of my schedule.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="box1">
                    <div class="box1title">Academic Goals</div>
                    <p>
                        Academically, my goal for Grade 9 is to strengthen my conceptual understanding rather than focusing only on marks.
                        I want to truly understand what I am learning and apply it confidently everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I aim to improve my problem-solving skills in Mathematics, develop deeper understanding in Science (mostly physics and chemistry),
                        and enhance clarity and structure in my English writing along with achieving C1 in it. Additionally, I want to be fluent in French, 
                        so I can understand day-to-day conversations, speak in it as if I am French and write in french without any problems. 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Plan:</b> I will do more questions rather than passively learning, which means I won't just read the textbook I will do more question so my brain is actively engaging with the information. For French, I will use the internet to learn it since gr9 won't have TL.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="box1">
                    <div class="box1title">Regarding Coding</div>
                    <p>
                        Beyond academics, I want to continue developing my skills, especially in coding and independent learning.
                        Also, I want to learn more about AI, python and web development in a deeper range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Plan:</b> I want to focus on consistency rather than rushing into advanced topics immediately, and learn how to debug properly,
                        experiment, and improve through practicing everyday.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="box1">
                    <div class="box1title">Personal Growth & Confidence</div>
                    <p>
                        Another important goal for Grade 9 is to grow more confident in expressing my ideas and trusting my abilities.
                        I want to participate more in events that enhance my public-speaking skills and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also want to focus on avoiding unnecessary comparison with others.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="box1">
                    <div class="box1title">Badminton!!</div>
                    <p>
                        Badminton plays an important role in my personal development.
                        My goal is to continue training consistently and improve my fitness, stamina, and skills. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Through badminton, I want to develop discipline, resilience, and patience, especially during challenging phases.</p>
                    <p><b>Plan:</b> I'll regularly apply my coach's advice in my game and participate tournaments to get that "match" knowledge. And then I can aim for districts probably.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="box1">
                    <div class="box1title">Reflection on Goals</div>
                    <p>
                        Setting these goals helped me stay intentional throughout the year. While I didn't achieve everything perfectly, 
                        having clear targets made me more aware of my progress and gave me direction when things felt overwhelming.
                    </p>
